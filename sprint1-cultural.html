                <p class="question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
                    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>

                <p>Just a few days ago, I was on the bus home when an older man started verbally abusing the bus driver for no reason other than that he thought 
                    the bus driver had given him a rude answer to his question (surprise surprise - he hadn’t). It escalated quite quickly and I was the only other person on the bus. 
                    The man started swearing and making racist comments, at which point my blood was boiling and I was starting to get up out of my seat.</p>

                <p>At that moment, I had to weigh up my options and decide what to do next: my gut was telling me to get involved and try to stand up for the bus driver 
                    who was very shaken and flustered, whereas my “sensible side” was telling me it probably wasn’t the best idea to get involved as the man seemed unpredictable 
                    and may have ended up physically harming myself or the driver.</p>

                <p>It all happened pretty quickly but I ended up staying seated until the man got off the bus (finishing it all off with a very rude, racist remark 
                    which made me even angrier). Once the man was off the bus, I approached the driver and told him I was really sorry he was treated like that, 
                    he didn’t deserve that at all and no one should be spoken to in such a derogatory and degrading manner. 
                    I tried to reassure him by telling him I witnessed everything that happened and he didn’t say or do anything wrong. 
                    The driver seemed pretty shaken and had to take a few minutes to collect himself before driving again. 
                    I just felt so awful that this driver had to deal with blatant racism and rudeness like that when he was just trying to do his job.</p>

                <p>My hindsight thoughts on this confrontation: On one hand, filming the encounter may have actually helped report the man who verbally abused the driver 
                    as I didn’t feel I could get physically involved. On the other hand, I would’ve felt bad just sitting there and filming it without doing anything. 
                    It’s a tough one and I’m still torn as to what I would do if I could go back in time, but I don’t regret my decision 
                    and think it was probably the most sensible reaction.</p>



                <p class="question">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>

                <p>I am lucky enough to have parents from two different cultures, New Zealand and Austria, and have also travelled a lot in the last six years, 
                    therefore feel multiple cultures have influenced me and my values. I will focus on three that I think have influenced the person I am today the most.</p>

                <p>I think the New Zealand culture is such a special one as we have a strong sense of identity and friendliness. 
                    This is something I learnt while overseas is so unique and is difficult to compare to other cultures. 
                    I think it’s taught me independence and taking matters into your own hands due to our country’s geographical independence. 
                    I also think Kiwis have an incredible sense of work ethic - I noticed overseas that employers always favoured Kiwis due to giving their all at work, 
                    even in menial tasks. I definitely consider this a strength of mine which I will elaborate on below.</p>

                <p>My first year overseas was spent in the south of Spain, in a small city called Granada. 
                    The southern Spanish culture taught me the values of family and the way Spanish people interact with each other really influenced me. 
                    They are a very physically affectionate bunch of people who love to socialise and spend all of their time surrounded by friends and family. 
                    This really taught me to appreciate those around me and I loved how they are completely unapologetic about their love for each other - exactly as I believe it should be.</p>

                <p>Lastly, I think the Scottish culture has influenced the way I see other people, my open-mindedness and standing up for what I believe in. 
                    In my time in Scotland, the country was going through a pivotal time of independence regarding Brexit and its strong apprehension towards leaving the European Union. 
                    Despite Scotland’s best efforts, the overall vote of the UK was still to leave the EU which angered the majority of Scotland’s people 
                    and caused a great movement towards independence from the United Kingdom in order to re-join the EU.<br>
                    Scottish people are also incredibly warm, friendly and open-minded. They welcome people from all walks of life with no hesitations and, in my experience, 
                    hold no (or very, very little) prejudice. This is something I have taken onboard in my personal growth, 
                    as I feel so many of the world’s problems today are due to prejudice and not understanding a person/group/culture.</p>
                
                <p class="question">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</p>
                
                <p>I completed the <a href="https://high5test.com/">“High 5 Test”</a> where my top 5 strengths were:</p>
                
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Empathiser</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to be empathetic to others' emotions. No one can step into the others' shoes better than you - it comes so naturally to you. 
                        You might not agree with every perspective and emotion, but most importantly you are able to understand what the person is going though.</p>
                    <li>Coach</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to develop people's potential. Contrary to what others might think, you believe that every person has the potential for development. 
                        You perceive it as a personal mission to help others utilize their potential and to experience success.</p>
                    <li>Deliverer</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to take responsibility. If there is a person who is emotionally bound to follow through on all promises - then it's you. 
                        Your strong ethical principles do not let you to simply write missteps off on excuses and rationalizations.</p>
                    <li>Time keeper</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to set timelines and deadlines. Because of your dislike of surprises, you love to plan. 
                        You don't necessarily need to control everything and everyone, but there must be order and predictability in the world around you.</p>
                    <li>Believer</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to believe and to do 'the right thing'. Of course, 'the right thing' differs from person to person, 
                        but one thing is true - you have a certain set of values that you are not ready to compromise.</p>
                </ul>

                <p>I then asked my partner to complete the same test, answering the questions about me to compare how I see myself to how others see me.<br>
                    His results about me were:</p>
                
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Believer</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to believe and to do 'the right thing'. Of course, 'the right thing' differs from person to person, but one thing is true - 
                        you have a certain set of values that you are not ready to compromise.</p>
                    <li>Philomath</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to learn new things. Due to your love of learning people tend to say you are a very curious person. 
                        You like to experiment with different styles of learning as well - in the end, there is something to learn from that as well, right?</p>
                    <li>Deliverer</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to take responsibility. If there is a person who is emotionally bound to follow through on all promises - then it's you. 
                        Your strong ethical principles do not let you to simply write missteps off on excuses and rationalizations.</p>
                    <li>Coach</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to develop people's potential. Contrary to what others might think, you believe that every person has the potential for development. 
                        You perceive it as a personal mission to help others utilize their potential and to experience success.</p>
                    <li>Time keeper</li>
                    <p>Your objective is to set timelines and deadlines. Because of your dislike of surprises, you love to plan. 
                        You don't necessarily need to control everything and everyone, but there must be order and predictability in the world around you.</p>
                </ul>

                <p class="question">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
                Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>

                <p>A strength of mine which has helped, and will continue to help, me greatly in my learning journey and career is my strong work ethic and determination. 
                    I don’t half-do a task or job - personally, I don’t see the point if you’re not going to give it your all. 
                    This may intersect with my learning obstacles by perhaps taking more time than I should to complete a task to the best of my ability 
                    which I know is something I need to be aware of throughout my time at EDA as we will be learning a lot of information in a very short space of time, 
                    therefore sometimes I will need to make myself move on to the next task.<br>
                    My work ethic ties in closely with my strong sense of determination. When I set my mind to something, you best believe I’m going to make it happen. 
                    I firmly believe life is what you make it and time flies by so fast that you may as well do everything in your power to live your best life.</p>

                <p>A second strength I’d like to talk about is empathy. I have always had a strong sense of empathy towards others which is something I am proud of 
                    and is definitely something I think we need more of in the world.<br>
                    It can also be a limitation however, which is something I’ve grown to realise more and more in recent years. 
                    Sometimes I find myself getting too caught up in other people’s problems - not in a nosy way, but more so in a way that I want to do anything I can to help them 
                    and make them feel better, often forgetting about myself in the process. I’m a bit of a “people pleaser” and find it hard to say no a lot of the time. 
                    Often my family and friends will lean on me for support and advice when things are hard in their lives, 
                    so this will be a challenge during my time at EDA as I need to put myself and my learning first.</p>

                <p>The last limitation I want to touch on is my “ability” to overthink - a blessing and a curse (I’m sure many can relate)! 
                    I tend to mostly overthink the way people see me, general day-to-day interactions and sometimes criticism. 
                    I think I’ve definitely improved in dealing with criticism and taking on-board the constructive advice that usually comes with it, 
                    but it’s something that I want to continue to work on so I can grow in my learning and career.</p>

                <p class="question">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
                    Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>

                <p>When living in Scotland, I was working as a supervisor in a restaurant/bar. The restaurant manager was never replaced after leaving, therefore I was basically doing two jobs but only being paid/acknowledged for the lesser of the two. 
                    It was a constant battle of being under-staffed, not having the resources we needed, the management team being generally pretty lazy.</p>

                <p>It was difficult to work for a company who didn’t really care about their staff. 
                    This filtered through to the management team feeling underappreciated, and therefore putting in the minimum effort required to run the place. 
                    It then also trickled down to the staff members who also started putting in minimum effort due to the example set by a lot of managers. 
                    I felt I was fighting an uphill battle as I was always trying my hardest to get the place running, order in everything we needed, and generally create a more positive, productive environment to work in. 
                    I tried to ask for the things we needed, create lists of tasks that needed to be done daily/weekly etc. to avoid problems arising during a busy service 
                    which happened very frequently. I was met with a fair bit of resistance due to general laziness and a “she’ll be right” attitude.</p>

                <p>It was a situation I struggled with as I wasn’t part of upper management so I couldn’t exactly tell those above me in the management team what to do, 
                    however I was the one rushed off my feet on a busy night when most of the time one or multiple of the managers would just be sitting in the office, 
                    not doing any work. It definitely tested my patience and I became very frustrated.</p>

                <p>In the end, I resigned from that job because it became way too much pressure and stress for very little pay and horrible working conditions. 
                    I don’t think I would change the way I handled the situation as I tried for over a year to improve the place and the way people thought about working there, with no real luck. 
                    I had the opportunity to speak to someone from the head office of the parent company when I resigned about why I was resigning and what could be improved in the venue, 
                    which I was very grateful for because it felt like the first time someone had actually listened to me and my ideas.</p>
