                <h3>HTML and CSS - an analogy that may or may not be original...</h3>

                <p>I’ve been racking my brain trying to come up with an original analogy to explain HTML, CSS and how they work together… So I’m going to use a cake analogy.</p>

                <p>Imagine a beautifully decorated, three-tier cake. In this analogy, HTML is the cake itself, made up of a blend of different ingredients to form the base. 
                HTML might also define some of the decorations, for example the cake might have a photo on the top. CSS comes in to control how the cake is decorated, or “styled”. 
                CSS would decide what shape each layer of the cake is, how high, what colour the icing is, where the decorations are placed, and so on.</p>

                <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
            
                <p><span class="italic">Control flow</span> is the order JavaScript is executed by the browser. This is important to recognise and make use of, 
                as often times it may be causing a bug in your code or altering the way things should be running due to being in the wrong order.</p>

                <p>Loops are a very useful part of JavaScript designed to allow you to repeat the same code over and over again until a certain condition is met. 
                To save you writing out super repetitive code, there are three main looping options: <span class="italic">for</span> loops, <span class="italic">while</span> loops and <span class="italic">do while</span> loops.</p>
                
                <p><span class="italic">For</span> loops are the most commonly used and take three optional expressions in the head of the loop, along with a statement that is executed as long as the conditions are equal to true. 
                For loops are used when you know the number of iterations you want the loop to do. The syntax of a for loop looks like this:</p>
                
                <img class="example-images" src="../images/sprint3-technical/forLoop.png" alt="Example of a for loop in JavaScript">

                <p>The <span class="italic">while</span> loop is fairly similar to the for loop in terms of use, however it is predominantly used when you don’t know the number of iterations. 
                The syntax also differs slightly:</p>
                
                <img class="example-images" src="../images/sprint3-technical/whileLoop.png" alt="Example of a while loop in JavaScript">

                <p>Finally, the <span class="italic">do while</span> loop is different to the above two examples in that it first runs the specified statement and only <span class="italic">then</span> evaluates whether the condition is true or false. 
                This means that even if the condition is false, the loop will always run at least once. The syntax for a do while loop is:</p>

                <img class="example-images" src="../images/sprint3-technical/doWhileLoop.png" alt="Example of a do while loop in JavaScript">

                <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>

                <p>The DOM stands for the <span class="italic">Document Object Model</span>. It lives mostly behind the scenes, is made up of a tree of objects called <span class="italic">“nodes”</span> and looks pretty similar to a family tree 
                (except each node only has one parent), as you can see here:</p>

                <img id="diagram" src="../images/sprint3-technical/DOMTree.jpg" alt="Tree diagram of the Document Object Model">

                <p>It starts at the top with your HTML document and then branches off to different sections of the website (e.g. head and body). 
                Each of these sections then have various elements branching off them (their children - div, h2, p etc.) with different values. 
                These can also have further children branching off them, and so on.</p>

                <p>When you load a web page, the browser takes the HTML from wherever it may be stored and converts it into the DOM. 
                From there, we can use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements and add, change or remove things from our page.</p>

                <p>The DOM could be very simple, as we see in the above diagram, or much more intricate and complicated-looking. 
                In saying that, if you dive deep into each section of the DOM, it is not as difficult or complicated as it looks!</p>

                <p>You can access the DOM from any webpage by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect”, which brings you to Google’s Developer Tools.</p>

                <h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>

                <p><span class="italic">Arrays</span> and <span class="italic">objects</span> are two of JavaScript’s data types.</p>

                <p>An <span class="italic">array</span> is a collection of data used to store multiple values (as opposed to a variable which can only store one value). 
                Each item in an array is contained within square brackets [ ], separated by a comma and given a number index 
                (the first item starting at 0, second item at 1, and so on) in order to be easily accessible. Here is an example of a simple array:</p>

                <img class="example-images" src="../images/sprint3-technical/arrayExample.png" alt="Example of an array in JavaScript">

                <p><span class="italic">Objects</span> can store even more data, often storing multiple different data types (including arrays!). 
                Objects hold data in a property, which has a key and one or multiple value/s. The properties are stored inside curly brackets { } and also separated by commas. 
                To access properties within an object, you can use dot notation and/or bracket notation. A basic object might look like this:</p>
                
                <img class="example-images" src="../images/sprint3-technical/objectExample.png" alt="Example of an object in JavaScript">

                <h3>A brief overview of functions</h3>

                <p><span class="italic">Functions</span> are brilliant for writing an executable piece of code that has a function and can be used over and over again throughout your document.</p>

                <p>It keeps code cleaner and tidier by not repeating the same thing again and again, and enables you to do all sorts of interesting things with JavaScript. 
                (Note: you must define a function within the scope you wish to call it, e.g. global or local scope, otherwise it will not run.)</p>

                <p>To define a function, the function keyword is used, followed by the function name (can be anything), a set of parentheses containing a list of parameters to be used by the function, 
                and finally the statements that the function will execute surrounded by curly brackets - { }.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Phew, this was a long one! That's all from me for now so until next time...<br>
                <br>
                Adios!</p>
