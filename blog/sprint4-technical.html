            <h3>A time I got blocked on a simple problem...</h3>
            <p>
                A time I got blocked on a simple problem was just yesterday when I was trying to solve the <span class="italic">whereAreYou</span> challenge as part of the <span class="italic">Built-in Functions</span> kata.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to make it return a number and my code was currently returning a string. I played around for so long thinking it was something to do with my code, when in the end it turned out to be such a silly, simple mistake - I had put the "else" rule in my if/else function to equal "Scooby isn't here!".<br>
                I did this right at the beginning when I was first writing out my code as I thought I might need something in case Scooby wasn't behind any of the doors, and then kind of just forgot about it. When I was looking for what the issue could be, it never crossed my mind that it was that string, even though it was staring right at me!
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve this problem, I tried many of the problem-solving techniques we've discussed at EDA. The main ones I used were pseudocode, trying something, googling and finally asking my facilitator for help. That was when I finally realised what I'd done!<br>
                Throughout the process I felt frustrated but I learnt that sometimes the bug in the code is a lot more obvious than you might think. The main lesson I took away was to go over my code throroughly and make sure it needs and uses every single thing in it.
            </p>

            <h3>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way...</h3>
            <p>
                This is a tricker one for me to answer because I don't feel like I've done a whole lot of elegant problem-solving so far... In saying that, when I was completing 
                the <span class="italic">JavaScript Olympics</span> kata, I used some problem solving to successfully (and fairly easily) solve the <span class="italic">Odds Out</span> challenge.
            </p> 
            <p>
                First I wrote what I wanted my function to do out in pseudocode. I tried a few different things and then remembered we'd done something very similar in the <span class="italic">Super FizzBuzz</span> kata. I used this to guide me to write the code for this challenge and also used Google to help me along the way.<br>
                I felt pretty calm and happy throughout the process, and super satisfied when my code worked pretty much first try! It definitely felt like progress was being made. The biggest lesson I took away from this experience is to refer back to previous code we've written as this can often be altered to fit the current challenge you're working on.
            </p>

            <!-- What was the problem?
            What problem solving techniques did you use?
            How did you feel throughout the process?
            What did you learn? -->

            <h3>Problem-solving techniques reflection</h3>
            <p>
                I feel pretty confident using most of the problem-solving techniques we've learnt about so far. As you can see from what I've written above, the ones I most commonly use/feel are the most helpful to me are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Trying something</li>
                <li>Googling</li>
                <li>console.log-ing</li>
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- Pseudocode, trying something, rubber ducky method, reading error messages, console.logging, googling, asking peers for help, asking coaches for help, improving process with reflection -->
