            <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
            <p class="compact">
                In no particular order...
            </p>
            <ol class="compact">
                <li>That I feel quite uneasy and am prone to stressing out a little when I can't do something or work out why it isn't functioning the way it should be.</li>
                <li>This might sound contradictory from the previous point, but that I appreciate the challenge of being thrown in the deep end and the satisfaction that comes along with figuring it out on my own.</li>
                <li>That despite my own self-doubt, I am very capable of learning this material and although I might not be the fastest or be able to write the most elegant code with the coolest features, I am proud of myself for achieving what I have so far and will continue to throughout my time at EDA.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <p>
                I think these all feed into my learning journey towards becoming a web developer in vital ways.<br>
                Values will influence the work I produce and the sorts of projects I choose to work on (or not work on). They are important because they will help me to grow and develop personally, as well as professionally.<br>
                In my opinion, empathy and self-awareness are more closely linked to one another and will help a lot when working in teams and with clients. Being able to step into someone else's shoes and try to see a situation (be it a problem, idea or something else) from their point of view is an essential part of being a successful developer - or most other professions for that matter! I do feel my empathy skills are strong already but am aware that I need to make sure I can control them in order to use them in the most effective way. This means also knowing when to take a step back and not get too involved in a situation if need be.
            </p>
            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
            <p>
                I think what has surprised me the most about the core modules of Foundations has been how much of it has made sense and actually been really useful when put into practice. That's not to say I doubted it to begin with, but I was surprised at how much of the material resonated with me even though I'd never really consciously thought about it before.<br>
                <br>
                The one that sticks out the most in this respect is growth mindset and neuroplasticity. I had never thought about how we can train our brains to learn new things and had always subconsciously fallen into the mindset of, "If I can't do it now, I'll never be able to." I definitely think learning about this in the core material helped me focus on pushing through some challenging parts of Foundations and helped me to remind myself that even though I might not be able to do it right now, I can get there. I definitely think this is an ability that will help me throughout Bootcamp and beyond.
            </p>
            <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
            <p>
                I did sometimes struggle to stick with the core material and put enough time into it when I really wanted to get onto the tech stuff. Some of the topics I found very interesting and eye-opening (e.g. neuroplasticity and growth mindset, as mentioned above), but others I found a little tedious and trying at times. Sometimes it was a challenge to put my all into this material but I am glad I pushed through as I definitely feel I've learned some very valuable lessons.
            </p>
            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
            bootcamp course?</h4>
            <p>
                From what I understand, some of the most important skills that a) employers look for in potential employees, and b) are missing from people in the technology sector are these core, "soft skills" such as problem solving, team work, recognising your own learning patterns/what works for you, and so on. These are the skills that will enhance a company's culture and enable people to work effectively and productively in teams.
            </p>
            <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <p>
                No, I don't consider it to be a waste of time at all. As I mentioned earlier, I did sometimes struggle to put my full energy and passion into some of the core topics when I was itching to get coding, however as we moved through Foundations, I could see more and more the benefits of studying this material. It is probably overlooked by many educational institutions so I am grateful that we were given the opportunity to spend time learning about the science behind some of these core skills and were given time for personal development.
