                <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
 
                <p>I had written my own definition of EI  but then I came across this one and thought it summed it up really nicely so thought I would feature it in my explanation.</p>
                <p id="quote">“Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, 
                communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.”
                <br> 
                <span id="source">
                    (Source: <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/emotional-intelligence-eq.htm">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/emotional-intelligence-eq.htm</a>)
                </span></p>
                
                <p>American psychologist, Daniel Goleman, who helped popularise emotional intelligence’s five key elements of EI are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Self-awareness</li>
                        <li>Self-regulation</li>
                        <li>Motivation</li>
                        <li>Empathy</li>
                        <li>Social skills</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>Some key indicators of a person having high emotional intelligence are benefiting from criticism, pausing to stop and think before saying something or taking action, 
                    demonstrating empathy, controlling one’s thoughts, giving helpful feedback and many more.</p>
                
                <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
                
                <p>While a person’s EQ/EI measures a person’s ability to identify, control and manage their emotions, 
                    IQ measures a person’s intelligence by one or a set of standardised test/s - usually to determine one’s academic abilities.</p>
                
                <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
                
                <p>Emotional intelligence is advantageous in many parts of a person’s professional and personal life. 
                    Good social communication enables one to work effectively in a team and a high EQ is often found in those who are in leadership positions, 
                    suggesting it is an important quality for managers and people in similar positions of power to have.</p>

                <p>You could have a very high IQ but without some or high emotional intelligence, it would be difficult to achieve your full potential in life. 
                    Particularly in a professional sense, your surroundings and day-to-day life might be quite stressful. 
                    Having EQ would be helpful to manage that stress and work through difficult situations, whether it’s alone or as part of a group.</p>
