        <p id="intro">Hi, I'm Ellora!</p>

        <p>I hail from sunny Nelson and have recently moved to Auckland after spending six years overseas.<br>
          Some hobbies of mine include photography, watching cute animal videos on the internet and having a wine or two with some pals, preferably in the sun.</p>
        <p> I enrolled in Dev Academy after being introuced to web development a few years ago and playing around with code as a hobby. 
          I had what I can best describe as a "semi-epiphany" a couple of years ago where I realised that I actually want to work in tech as a career, so here I am!</p>
