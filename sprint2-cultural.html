                <p>My long term goal is to start a career in the technology sector. 
                At this stage, I’m really interested in becoming a web developer (hence why I’m at EDA!), however I also have a strong interest in app development. 
                This is something I might look at pursuing further down the line but for now, my main goal is to get a job as a junior developer and go from there.</p>

                <p>In terms of what human skills I’d like to develop while at EDA, I’d really like to work on my time management skills. 
                I’m a pretty organised person in general, but somehow I always find it difficult to organise my time efficiently and stay on-task.<br>
                Another human skill I’d like to work on is communication. This invaluable skill links closely with teamwork and leadership, 
                both of which are crucial skills for working in tech. I do think I have pretty good communication skills already but I think there’s always room for improvement. 
                From my understanding, there is a lot of teamwork involved in EDA so it’s very important that everybody communicates clearly and effectively.<br>
                Lastly, I would like to improve my active listening skills and take onboard other people’s ideas, feedback and opinions.</p>

                <p>I believe my strengths currently lie in empathy, leadership and perfectionism. 
                My limitations are also perfectionism (true double-edged sword!), self-doubt and saying “no”.</p>

                <p><span class="important">My commitment as to how I will manage my workload in the EDA programme is as follows:</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                I will organise my time effectively by mapping out when I will do work for EDA, when I have free time and when I am working at my other job (during Foundations). 
                By doing this, I will ensure I have enough time to get through the content and extra time to revise/practice, 
                as well as a bit of time to relax and do life admin without feeling guilty that I “should” be working. 
                Obviously there will be a lot less opportunity for this “free time” once Bootcamp starts but I am aware of this and willing to commit myself and my time fully.<br>
                I will structure the time I am spending on EDA work so that I break down the week’s tasks into manageable chunks 
                and make sure I am giving myself small breaks every 30 minutes to one hour (depending on how much of a roll I am on at that given moment).</p>
                
                <p><span class="important">A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way is as follows:</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is one of the big parts where my communication skills will come into play. 
                I will communicate openly and honestly with my facilitator/s and other staff at EDA about how I am doing and what I might be struggling with. 
                This will benefit both me, as I will feel comfortable that they are up to date on where I’m at, and the teachers/staff from EDA, as they will know how I’m finding the material and workload.<br>
                I hope that the facilitation team will be available for me to ask any questions I might have, give constructive feedback/criticism, 
                let me know how I’m doing in the broader scheme of things and hopefully give some career/job seeking advice towards the end of EDA.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                During Foundations, I am working 1-2 days a week in my old full-time job at a technology wholesaler. At the time of writing, this will fall on Wednesdays and sometimes Thursdays. 
                Aside from this, I don’t have any other major commitments that I need to block-out time for.</p>
