                <h4>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h4>
 
                <p>When people understand how neuroplasticity works, they are more likely to achieve to a higher potential due to realising that their brain CAN change and adapt. 
                Rather than feeling like a failure when something doesn’t work the way they wanted it to, they can recognise that with more work, they can achieve it - 
                that is not the end for them.</p>

                <h4>How I am going to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit...</h4>

                <p>I think it’ll help me greatly in my time at Dev Academy (and beyond, of course) because there will be a lot of times where I will fail, probably over and over again, 
                and I will remind myself of neuroplasticity principles and not get frustrated just because I didn’t do it perfectly the first time - 
                I can still try again and again until I get it.</p>

                <h4>Some ways to increase neuroplasticity...</h4>

                <p>Some ways to increase neuroplasticity are setting realistic goals, adapting a growth mindset, practice mindfulness 
                (do regular exercise, get into nature, ensure you are looking after your physical and mental wellbeing, sleep enough, eat well etc…) and to stop procrastinating 
                (I’m very guilty of this one!). There are obviously many more things you can do to increase neuroplasticity but these are the ones that stood out to me as being 
                the most effective and realistic.</p>

                <h4>Here is a resource that I found particularly useful in this exercise...</h4>

                <p><a href="http://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/">This</a> website provided a really clear overview of neuroplasticity and outlined some ways you can increase it. Easy to follow but very informative.</p>

                <h4>What is growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h4>

                <p>Growth mindset links closely to neuroplasticity, that is, it is the mindset you are in once you understand and embrace what neuroplasticity works 
                and how you can implement it. Simply put, having a growth mindset sees failure as a chance to learn, as opposed to seeing it as a permanent failure. 
                Intelligence is malleable and humans are fully capable of building new pathways and changing the brain.</p>

                <h4>Things that surprised me in this exploration...</h4>

                <p>Something that has surprised me from this research is how easy it is to understand the growth mindset concept. 
                It seems so simple to me now, but I’ve never thought about it or considered how my mindset may be affecting my learning!</p>

                <h4>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h4>

                <p>I am excited to integrate a growth mindset into the next few challenging months at Dev Academy, and beyond that into my career. 
                I will be very self-aware of when I fail at something and remind myself of how this is an <span class="italic">opportunity</span>, rather than a <span class="italic">set-back</span>. 
                I will also try to put information in context by linking it to things I already know (this forms stronger neural connections = easier to remember).</p>

                <h4>Here is a resource that I found particularly useful in this exercise...</h4>

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU">This</a> video compares a fixed mindset to a growth mindset in an easily-digestible way. 
                It points out a lot of interesting differences and hints at why having a growth mindset is a very useful tool.</p>
